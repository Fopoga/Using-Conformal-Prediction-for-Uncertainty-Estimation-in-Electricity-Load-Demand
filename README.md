## üìñ Thesis Summary

This repository contains the code and supporting material for my Master‚Äôs Thesis,  
**‚ÄúUsing Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Estimation in Electricity Load Demand‚Äù**.

The thesis explores **probabilistic load forecasting** using data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014).
The focus is on building **prediction intervals** that quantify uncertainty in electricity demand,  
comparing several state-of-the-art methods:

- **Quantile Regression Forests (QRF)**: a non-parametric tree-based ensemble for conditional quantiles.  
- **Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR)**: combines quantile regression with conformal calibration  
  to ensure finite-sample validity.  
- **Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals (EnbPI)**: bootstrap-based intervals adapted for time series.  
- **Adaptive EnbPI**: a variant of EnbPI that dynamically adjusts intervals over time.

The thesis demonstrates the trade-off between **calibration** (empirical coverage close to nominal levels)  
and **sharpness** (narrow prediction intervals), highlighting the contexts in which each method is preferable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods Overview

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  Calendar-based one-hot encodings (weekend, holiday, month, hour, season) and  
  temperature from 25 anonymized weather stations (W1‚ÄìW25).  

- **Models**:  
  - QRF implemented with the [Zillow `quantile-forest`](https://zillow.github.io/quantile-forest/) library.  
  - CQR and EnbPI implemented with the [PUNCC](https://deel-ai.github.io/puncc/theory_overview.html) framework.  
  - Evaluation via **Pinball Loss**, **Empirical Coverage**, and **Interval Width**.  

- **Main Findings**:  
  - QRF provides a strong non-parametric baseline but lacks calibrated coverage.  
  - CQR corrects miscalibration while keeping intervals sharp.  
  - EnbPI yields much narrower intervals but systematically under-covers.  
  - Adaptive EnbPI improves slightly but still fails to reach nominal coverage, with high computational cost.

## ‚ö° Data

The dataset comes from the **GEFCom2014 Probabilistic Load Forecasting track**:  
- Hourly load data (2005‚Äì2011).  
- Hourly temperature records from 25 anonymized weather stations (2001‚Äì2011).  
- Public description:  
  - Hong et al. (2016) *Probabilistic energy forecasting: Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 and beyond*.  
  - Gaillard et al. (2016) *GEFCom2014 probabilistic electric load forecasting: An integrated solution*.

## üìä Results Summary

- **QRF**: Good adaptation to data, but empirical coverage differs from nominal.  
- **CQR**: Achieves calibrated coverage (80%, 90%, 96%) with slightly narrower intervals than QRF.  
- **EnbPI**: Produces much sharper intervals but consistently under-covers.  
- **Adaptive EnbPI**: Small improvements with higher sigma quantiles, but still under nominal and time conssuming.
